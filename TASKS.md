## Backlog Rules

Every task is executable/reviewable, delivers a visible result, and begins `Not Started`. Work only on tasks in `.ai/CURRENT_MILESTONE.md`; do not open more than one milestone. Every task inherits `AGENTS.md`, `docs/09-coding-standards.md`, `docs/13-definition-of-done.md`, the shared UI contract in `.ai/UI_SCREENS.md`, and the manual-only verification directive.

Reuse Laravel, Flux UI, and a single approved mature package where appropriate. Do not build authentication, permissions, audit, Excel, PDF, barcode, backup, media/upload, data table, pagination, filter/sort, picker, searchable select, modal/drawer, toast/alert, chart, sidebar, breadcrumbs, form controls, loading, or empty state from scratch when an approved capability exists. Package names/versions are not approved until the actual Laravel project is inspected. Automated tests are currently deferred; no task creates or runs automated tests.

## Phase 1 — Foundation, Access and Operational Controls

### TSK-001 — Establish the Laravel Platform and Operational Baseline

- **Task ID / Phase / Milestone / Status:** TSK-001; Phase 1; DM 1.1; **In Progress — specific local work remains: the actual local backup/restore capability/status and setup/run/recovery deployment/rollback runbooks are not implemented, and custom bilingual 419/429 error views are not present (framework fallback only).**
- **Implementation Progress:** The local platform assigns a server-generated UUID request ID through Laravel Context and returns it as `X-Request-ID` on normal and rendered exception responses. Resilient bilingual error views, maintenance behavior, health authorization, and the local runtime/build baseline are present and manually verified. The remaining local gap is the required actual backup/restore capability/status and setup/run/recovery documentation; production provider, destination, RPO/RTO, monitoring, and support decisions remain separate production blockers.
- **Title / Purpose / Description:** Establish and verify the single-repository Laravel modular-monolith baseline, environments, safe configuration, queues/scheduler/cache decision, logging/monitoring, attachment storage, backup/restore and deployment runbook. Implementation was explicitly authorized on 2026-08-02.
- **Traceability:** PRD NFR-01, NFR-04, NFR-07; Stories US-032; Flows FLW-AUTH-01, FLW-RPT-03; UI UI-SYS-003–004, UI-SYS-010; AC AC-NFR-01, AC-NFR-04, AC-NFR-07; Security SEC-027–031.
- **Dependencies / Required Inputs:** Local PHP/Laravel/SQLite baseline implemented; BLK-001–BLK-002 remain for production hosting/domain/database, Redis/queue/scheduler, storage/backup RPO/RTO, and monitoring/support owners.
- **Database Entities:** platform configuration plus `attachments`, `audit_logs`, `approval_records` logical baseline; no production schema beyond authorized foundation.
- **Backend / Livewire / Blade Deliverables:** Laravel foundation and environment/runbooks; health/backup status read models; full-page health/backup screens only if approved; safe error Blade views. No speculative module code.
- **UI / Flux / Alpine / Vite:** UI-SYS-003, UI-SYS-004, UI-SYS-010; Flux Cards/Tables/Badges/Alerts/Progress/Error; Alpine none; Vite verified common entry and production assets.
- **Suggested Packages:** Candidate capability only for backup and error monitoring after compatibility/security/license review; no package preselected or installed.
- **Permissions / Validation / Audit / States / Print:** Administrator/Support/Reviewer scope; no secret display; environment/backup actions confirmed/audited; health states healthy/degraded/down; backup queued/success/fail; print authorized status report only.
- **Manual Browser Verification:** Confirm production-safe errors/health authorization; create and restore an approved isolated backup; verify worker/scheduler/storage/monitoring signal and no secret leakage.
- **Definition of Done:** `docs/13-definition-of-done.md`, DM 1.1 exit criteria, actual setup/run/recovery documentation, recorded evidence, no unresolved critical platform blocker.

### TSK-002 — Implement Authentication, Sessions, and Account Recovery

- **Task ID / Phase / Milestone / Status:** TSK-002; Phase 1; DM 1.1; **Completed for approved local scope**.
- **Closure Audit (2026-08-03):** Browser verification passed for valid and invalid login, generic credential errors, rate limiting, reset request, actual expired-token rejection, single-use-token rejection after a successful local reset, session regeneration, logout/direct denial, CSRF origin rejection, locale/direction, and responsive auth layout. Production identity, MFA, lockout, password, mail, and session-policy values remain in BLK-005.
- **Title / Purpose / Description:** Deliver maintained Laravel session authentication, login, forgot/reset password, logout/revocation, locale/profile basics, and safe denied behavior without a custom auth framework.
- **Traceability:** NFR-01, NFR-03–NFR-04; US-032; FLW-AUTH-01; UI-AUTH-001–002, UI-SYS-008–009; AC-NFR-01, AC-NFR-03–04; SEC-001–005, SEC-011.
- **Dependencies / Required Inputs:** TSK-001; BLK-005; identity fields, password/reset/session/MFA/lockout policy.
- **Database Entities:** `users`, framework session/reset structures as verified, `audit_logs`.
- **Backend / Livewire / Blade Deliverables:** auth routes/controllers/actions/policies using framework conventions; profile/session actions; Blade/Livewire auth/profile screens per actual starter approach.
- **UI / Flux / Alpine / Vite:** Flux Card/Input/Checkbox/Button/Alert/Loading/Dialog; Alpine none unless framework component requires minimal behavior; Vite common auth assets.
- **Suggested Packages:** Laravel-native authentication capability/starter appropriate to Blade/Livewire; do not add duplicate auth package.
- **Permissions / Validation / Audit / States / Print:** guest/authenticated boundaries; credential/reset/password validation; generic errors/rate limits; login/reset/session events; active/locked/expired; Print None.
- **Manual Browser Verification:** Valid/invalid/locked login, rate limit, reset expiry/single use, session regeneration/logout/revocation, CSRF, direct denied route, RTL/LTR/responsive/accessibility.
- **Definition of Done:** DoD plus owner session policy satisfied and all actual results recorded.

### TSK-003 — Build Application Layouts and Restricted PWA Shell

- **Task ID / Phase / Milestone / Status:** TSK-003; Phase 1; DM 1.1; **Completed for approved local scope**.
- **Closure Audit (2026-08-03):** Auth, Admin, Operations, and POS shells were reviewed in the browser at desktop/mobile widths in Arabic RTL and English LTR. Manifest, service worker, online/offline state, private-cache boundary, navigation visibility, and direct denial passed. Actual devices, printer/scanner integration, install/update support, and offline policy remain production/UAT concerns in BLK-003/BLK-004.
- **Title / Purpose / Description:** Build Auth, Admin, Operations, and lightweight POS layouts in one Laravel app with context navigation, locale/direction, responsive behavior, PWA install/update shell and connectivity state.
- **Traceability:** NFR-03–NFR-05, NFR-07; US-032; FLW-AUTH-01, FLW-OFF-01; UI UI-SYS-001–002, UI-OFF-001; AC-NFR-03–05, AC-NFR-07, AC-UI-01–04; SEC-011–013, SEC-031–034.
- **Dependencies / Required Inputs:** TSK-001–002; BLK-003–BLK-004; browsers/devices, PWA/offline decision, context-switch policy.
- **Database Entities:** user/role/scope context and future offline device registry (final table names at implementation).
- **Backend / Livewire / Blade Deliverables:** scoped context resolver; Blade layouts; Livewire navigation/context/PWA state where useful; service worker only for approved shell/static policy.
- **UI / Flux / Alpine / Vite:** Flux Sidebar/Header/Breadcrumb/Dropdown/Badge/Dialog/Toast; Alpine/small TypeScript for connectivity/install/update only; Vite common + minimal POS/PWA entry.
- **Suggested Packages:** PWA capability candidate only after service-worker compatibility/security review; prefer platform APIs for simple install/connectivity.
- **Permissions / Validation / Audit / States / Print:** scope-aware navigation and server policy; validate context switch; audit sensitive scope changes/device enrollment; online/offline/update/unsupported; None.
- **Manual Browser Verification:** Layouts at target widths, keyboard/touch, Arabic RTL/English LTR, direct denial, locale/context, install/update/cache behavior, unsynced-queue protection.
- **Definition of Done:** DoD; no separate frontend/API/SPA; no sensitive response cache; approved device behavior evidenced.

### TSK-004 — Establish the Shared UI Foundation

- **Task ID / Phase / Milestone / Status:** TSK-004; Phase 1; DM 1.1; **Completed for approved local scope**.
- **Closure Audit (2026-08-03):** The UI showcase and current platform screens were visually reviewed for page shell/header, forms, tables, filters, pagination, dialogs, alerts/toasts, badges, loading/empty/error/denied/success/disabled states, audit/timeline patterns, print-base structure, RTL/LTR, responsive behavior, focus/contrast basics, and bounded mobile layout. The health metadata table retains a bounded inner horizontal scroll at 390px as a recorded Low presentation note; no document overflow or Critical/High defect remains.
- **Title / Purpose / Description:** Implement the limited shared visual language and reusable shell/page/table/form/status/timeline/audit/print patterns using Flux UI first.
- **Traceability:** NFR-05, NFR-07; US-032; all flows/screens; UI UI-SYS-001, UI-SYS-005–010; AC-UI-01–05; SEC-006–007, SEC-011, SEC-016, SEC-024.
- **Dependencies / Required Inputs:** TSK-003; approved bilingual font/brand colors if available; Flux version compatibility.
- **Database Entities:** None beyond UI read models; attachment/audit patterns consume their documented entities.
- **Backend / Livewire / Blade Deliverables:** scoped/paginated list conventions, localized validation/error responses; reusable Blade/Livewire page patterns and print base templates.
- **UI / Flux / Alpine / Vite:** Flux form controls, table/pagination, modal/dialog/drawer, toast/alert, badges, breadcrumbs, cards, states; Alpine only minimal interaction; Tailwind semantic tokens/logical directions; Vite shared styles.
- **Suggested Packages:** None for internal design system; Flux UI is primary. Font/package only after license/performance review.
- **Permissions / Validation / Audit / States / Print:** component examples must demonstrate denied/validation/loading/empty/error/success/disabled; no sensitive data; print base thermal/A4/label/PDF.
- **Manual Browser Verification:** Component/pattern matrix across locales/directions/viewports/keyboard/touch/contrast/text expansion/print preview.
- **Definition of Done:** DoD; no duplicate custom Flux components; pattern documentation and examples reflect actual implementation.

### TSK-004B — Implement Persistent UI Customizer and Contextual Tutorial Assistant

- **Task ID / Phase / Milestone / Status:** TSK-004B; Platform shared feature; **In Progress (2026-08-04)**.
- **Purpose:** Add persistent Appearance Customizer and permission-aware, bilingual Contextual Page Guide/Tutorial Assistant without changing business workflows, authorization grants, commercial policy, or unrelated task statuses.
- **Implementation:** Shared `TutorialRegistry`, `UserFlowRegistry`, `PageGuideContext`, `user_ui_preferences`, persistent dashboard/POS controls, bounded drawer/full guide/flow views, and a small explicit-selector guided tour.
- **Initial real coverage:** UI-SYS-001/002/003/004, UI-ADM-002/003/004/005/010/011/012, UI-CAT-001/002/003/004/006/007. Non-existent proposed screens are not fabricated.
- **Definition of Done:** Shared controls, persisted preferences, registered guides/flows, permission/scope filtering, tour behavior, documentation, and real-browser evidence under `artifacts/platform-dashboard-assistant/`; no Critical/High defect; no UAT/production-readiness claim.
- **Traceability:** US-046; FLW-UI-01, FLW-HELP-01, FLW-HELP-02; AC-UI-06–15; `docs/40-contextual-page-guide-specification.md`.

### Cross-cutting local slice — Initial Setup Dashboard / First Launch Configuration

- **Status:** Implemented for Local/Dev scope on 2026-08-06; Arabic-first visual/translation polish verified on 2026-08-07; Production/UAT values and Owner approvals remain open.
- **Purpose:** Present a permission-gated first-launch setup dashboard that derives readiness from authoritative data, provides the safe pending financial-setting input, and links the Owner to existing data-entry screens. The screen now also publishes `UI-ADM-013` contextual help, a six-step Arabic/English interactive tour, and the `FLW-ADM-06` ordered setup workflow.
- **Required steps:** Company identity; active branch/store structure; active supplier-return reason catalog; approved/effective supplier-return numbering and print financial settings; active role assignment for the opening team.
- **Optional step:** Printer profile review. Production device acceptance remains a separate UAT gate.
- **Safety:** No production defaults, reason catalog entries, production approval limits, production users, or approvals are created automatically. The owner-authorized Demo register may contain clearly labeled pending examples; pending/locked-only financial versions do not count as ready, and only an effective, non-expired version linked to an approved `ApprovalRecord` counts.
- **Routes / permissions:** `/dashboard` shows the setup panel when required data is missing; `/initial-setup` is limited to `company_settings.edit`. Existing settings, branches, authorization baseline, and supplier-return settings screens remain the data-entry surfaces.
- **Evidence:** Browser-verified with Local Demo Administrator at `/dashboard`, `/initial-setup`, and `/purchasing/returns/settings`; after explicit owner authorization, Demo company identity is populated as `TOY & JOY - Local Demo / EGP / ج.م`, readiness is `3/5 (60%)`, and four supplier-return financial policy examples are visible as `Awaiting approval`. Existing payment/tax/numbering/printer Demo rows are explicitly labeled; `supplier_return_reasons=0`, `approved_versions=0`, and no `ApprovalRecord` was created for these Demo values. Non-administrative Local Demo Cashier received the existing Access Denied screen; console reported zero JavaScript errors. `DemoSeeder` completed successfully on the local SQLite database after preserving invoice-referenced purchase-order lines.

### TSK-005 — Configure Company, Payment, Tax, Numbering, and Printer Settings

- **Task ID / Phase / Milestone / Status:** TSK-005; Phase 1; DM 1.2; **In Progress — specific local work remains: effective-date fields/overlap validation and configuration print-preview flows are not implemented.**
- **Closure Audit (2026-08-03):** Company, payment/evidence, tax, numbering, printer configuration, update, duplicate, audit, and local TBD behavior were browser-verified. The remaining local gaps are the effective-date form/overlap guard and actual thermal/A4/label configuration preview flows; production tax/payment/numbering/template/printer values remain BLK-008.
- **Title / Purpose / Description:** Deliver company identity, payment methods, effective tax settings, concurrency-safe numbering configurations, printer/templates and customer-policy settings.
- **Traceability:** MD-01, NFR-01–NFR-02, NFR-06; US-001; FLW-ADM-05; UI UI-ADM-002, UI-ADM-006–009; AC-MD-01, AC-NFR-01–02, AC-NFR-06; SEC-017–018, SEC-039.
- **Dependencies / Required Inputs:** Owner-authorized temporary sequencing exception DEC-031 and minimum local audit exception DEC-033; BLK-008 remains Open; company/currency/tax/methods/sequences/printers/templates/policies. DEC-033 authorizes only append-only local audit records for successful TSK-005 settings writes, not approval, attachment, retention/redaction, immutability, or production audit policy. Do not infer unapproved business or production policy.
- **Database Entities:** `companies`, `payment_methods`, `tax_settings`, `document_sequences`, `printer_configurations`, `audit_logs`, `approval_records`.
- **Backend / Livewire / Blade Deliverables:** settings models/migrations/actions/policies/version/effective rules/locked numbering; full-page setting screens and Blade print previews.
- **UI / Flux / Alpine / Vite:** Flux Forms/Tables/Date/Select/Switch/Tabs/Preview/Dialog/Badges; Alpine none except print preview; common Vite assets.
- **Suggested Packages:** Barcode/PDF/print capability not selected here; evaluate only when actual outputs require it.
- **Permissions / Validation / Audit / States / Print:** Administrator manage, Reviewer view/export; unique/overlap/pattern/dependency validation; all changes/audits; active/inactive/effective; preview/test prints.
- **Manual Browser Verification:** Duplicate/effective/unsafe deactivate and concurrent sequence allocation; unauthorized access; tax/method/evidence settings; thermal/A4/label preview RTL/LTR.
- **Definition of Done:** DoD and DM 1.2 business inputs approved; past documents unaffected.

### TSK-006 — Configure Branches, Stores, and Selling-Store Mapping

- **Task ID / Phase / Milestone / Status:** TSK-006; Phase 1; DM 1.2; **Completed for approved local scope**.
- **Closure Audit (2026-08-03):** Branch/store lifecycle, duplicate/dependency guards, effective mapping/history, audit, direct denial, scope-filtered navigation, RTL/LTR, and responsive behavior were reviewed. The selling-store picker and action now enforce same-branch mapping. Production branch/store data and assignments remain BLK-006.
- **Title / Purpose / Description:** Deliver branch/store masters, types/status, branch selling-store assignment/history, and controlled manager override context.
- **Traceability:** MD-01, INV-02, NFR-01, NFR-03; US-001, US-013; FLW-ADM-01–02; UI UI-ADM-003–004; AC-MD-01, AC-INV-02; SEC-011–012, SEC-015, SEC-039.
- **Dependencies / Required Inputs:** TSK-005; BLK-006; approved lists/types/mappings/overrides.
- **Database Entities:** `branches`, `stores`, `branch_selling_stores`, `approval_records`, `audit_logs`.
- **Backend / Livewire / Blade Deliverables:** master/state/dependency rules, scope policies, effective mapping and override action; branch/store list/forms/detail.
- **UI / Flux / Alpine / Vite:** Flux Tables/Search/Filters/Pagination/Forms/Combobox/Timeline/Dialog/Badges; Alpine none; common assets.
- **Suggested Packages:** None; Laravel/Flux native patterns.
- **Permissions / Validation / Audit / States / Print:** Administrator manage; branch/warehouse roles scoped view; unique codes, safe deactivate, non-overlap mapping; mapping/override audit; active/inactive; optional register print/export.
- **Manual Browser Verification:** Create/edit/deactivate, duplicate/dependency, map one selling store, cross-scope denial, direct request, override reason/approval/audit, responsive RTL/LTR.
- **Definition of Done:** DoD; approved structure loaded and mapping history trustworthy.

### TSK-007 — Configure Cash Drawer Masters and Assignments

- **Task ID / Phase / Milestone / Status:** TSK-007; Phase 1; DM 1.2; **Completed for approved local scope**.
- **Closure Audit (2026-08-03):** Drawer list/create/update/dependency validation, duplicate handling, branch/store consistency, cross-branch prevention, empty/error/success states, server authorization, audit, RTL/LTR, and responsive behavior were reviewed. Shift dependency is explicitly safe/TBD because shift entities do not yet exist; production drawer allocation remains BLK-006.

- **Title / Purpose / Description:** Create branch/store-scoped drawer masters and safe assignment/status lifecycle used later by shifts.
- **Traceability:** MD-01, CSH-01, NFR-01, NFR-03; US-001, US-024; FLW-ADM-03; UI UI-ADM-005; AC-MD-01, AC-CSH-01; SEC-011–012, SEC-017, SEC-019, SEC-039.
- **Dependencies / Required Inputs:** TSK-006; approved drawer allocation/codes/status policy.
- **Database Entities:** `cash_drawers`, `branches`, `stores`, `audit_logs`.
- **Backend / Livewire / Blade Deliverables:** drawer model/policy/dependency guards; list/create/edit/deactivate screen.
- **UI / Flux / Alpine / Vite:** Flux Table/Filters/Search/Pagination/Form/Select/Badge/Dialog; Alpine none; common assets.
- **Suggested Packages:** None.
- **Permissions / Validation / Audit / States / Print:** Administrator manage; Branch Manager proposed scope; unique code, consistent assignment, no reassign/retire with active shift; changes audited; optional assignment register.
- **Manual Browser Verification:** Duplicate, cross-branch assignment, dependency/active-shift guard, permission/direct URL, empty/error/success, responsive RTL/LTR.
- **Definition of Done:** DoD; drawer data ready for DM 3.3 without inventing opening balances.

### TSK-008 — Implement Users, Roles, Permissions, and Scopes

- **Task ID / Phase / Milestone / Status:** TSK-008; Phase 1; DM 1.3; **Completed (2026-08-03; DEC-038 canonical matrix seeded; all current application surfaces are server-enforced, scope-filtered, tested, and visually verified).**
- **Title / Purpose / Description:** Implement approved role/permission matrix with branch/store/action/document/field/approval/override and own-record scopes.
- **Traceability:** MD-01, CUS-02, NFR-03; US-001, US-032; FLW-ADM-04; UI UI-ADM-010–012, UI-SYS-009; AC-MD-01, AC-CUS-02, AC-NFR-03; SEC-011–016, SEC-039.
- **Dependencies / Required Inputs:** DEC-038 canonical matrix. Future module-specific enforcement remains a dependency of its corresponding implementation task, not a blocker to this completed current-scope authorization foundation.
- **Database Entities:** `users`, `roles`, `permissions`, role/user/permission pivots, `user_branch_scopes`, `user_store_scopes`, `audit_logs`.
- **Backend / Livewire / Blade Deliverables:** policies/gates/scoped queries and grant/revoke actions; user/role/permission screens/matrix.
- **UI / Flux / Alpine / Vite:** Flux Tables/Matrix Controls/Filters/Combobox/Tabs/Drawer/Dialog/Badges; Alpine only matrix affordance if Flux/Livewire insufficient; common assets.
- **Suggested Packages:** Mature Laravel permission package candidate after version/maintenance/fit review; do not build a permission engine or install yet.
- **Permissions / Validation / Audit / States / Print:** Administrator manage, Reviewer view; last-admin/self-lockout, invalid grant/scope, alias and limit validation; every grant/revoke audit; matrix PDF/export by right.
- **Manual Browser Verification:** Every role allowed/denied navigation/direct routes/actions/scopes/fields/exports; Cashier/Party Wallet and Party Manager/Product Wallet isolation; Counter approval denial.
- **Definition of Done:** Completed for current scope: canonical roles/permission catalog seeded; current routes, Livewire actions, navigation, and scoped queries enforced; role/scope changes audited; focused automated and browser verification passed; no `P`/`R` permission silently granted. See `docs/16-authorization-traceability.md` for deferred modules.

### TSK-009 — Implement Approval, Audit, Attachment, and Immutability Controls

- **Task ID / Phase / Milestone / Status:** TSK-009; Phase 1; DM 1.4; **In Progress (new implementation paused during the TSK-001–TSK-008 closure audit; no new TSK-009 implementation occurred in this session).**
- **Title / Purpose / Description:** Deliver append-only approvals/audit, protected attachments, per-document state-transition conventions, immutable approved records, source corrections, and number allocation integration.
- **Traceability:** NFR-01–NFR-04, NFR-06; US-001, US-032; FLW-ADM-05, FLW-RPT-03; UI UI-SYS-005–006, UI-AUD-001; AC-NFR-01–04, AC-NFR-06; SEC-015, SEC-017–020, SEC-022–024, SEC-027.
- **Dependencies / Required Inputs:** TSK-008; `docs/17-approval-policy.md`, `docs/18-attachment-media-policy.md`, `docs/19-audit-immutability-policy.md`, `docs/30-platform-operations-specification.md`, `docs/35-document-state-machines.md`, `docs/36-module-data-contracts.md`, `docs/37-ui-screen-specifications.md`, and `docs/38-print-export-specification.md`. Production storage, legal wording, infrastructure, and final numeric limits remain configurable or pending approval.
- **Database Entities:** `approval_records`, `audit_logs`, `attachments`, `document_sequences`; source/reference fields on future documents.
- **Backend / Livewire / Blade Deliverables:** focused reusable approval/audit/attachment actions/policies, transition/immutable guards, authorized file delivery; inbox/audit/detail patterns.
- **UI / Flux / Alpine / Vite:** Flux Table/Filters/Pagination/Drawer/Diff/Timeline/File Upload/Dialog/Toast/Badges; Alpine none; file preview/print assets only as needed.
- **Suggested Packages:** Mature audit/activity and media capability candidates after compatibility/security review; avoid overlapping packages/custom engines.
- **Permissions / Validation / Audit / States / Print:** explicit submit/approve/reject/override/reverse/cancel/delete/export; MIME/signature/size/hash/purpose; required self-audit; append-only states; audit/approval exports and source prints.
- **Manual Browser Verification:** Stale/unauthorized transition, approval separation, original edit/delete denial, referenced correction, unsafe/cross-scope file, before/after redaction, duplicate numbering/action.
- **Definition of Done:** DoD and Phase 1 gate; critical actions record required context and originals remain preserved.

## Phase 2 — Catalog, Purchasing, Pricing, and Inventory

### TSK-010 — Build Product, Category, Brand, Code, and Barcode Masters

- **Task ID / Phase / Milestone / Status:** TSK-010; Phase 2; DM 2.1; **Completed for approved local scope (2026-08-04).** Production catalog inputs, UAT, and milestone/phase gates remain open.
- **Title / Purpose / Description:** Create stable product identity, category hierarchy, brands, supplier/local barcode allocation and exact search behavior.
- **Traceability:** MD-02–MD-03, MD-05; US-002; FLW-CAT-01; UI UI-CAT-001–003, UI-CAT-006–007; AC-MD-02–03, AC-MD-05; SEC-006, SEC-011–012, SEC-019–021.
- **Dependencies / Required Inputs:** Phase 1 gate; BLK-009 mitigated by `docs/23-product-barcode-policy.md`; production hierarchy, real master data, supplier-code allocation, and final attributes remain configurable or pending.
- **Database Entities:** Local TSK-010 implements `products`, `categories`, `brands`, `barcodes`, and `barcode_sequences`. Full `suppliers`/`product_suppliers` master/history remains deferred to TSK-013; no supplier master was fabricated.
- **Backend / Livewire / Blade Deliverables:** models/migrations/relations/unique and hierarchy rules/barcode action; paginated masters and product list/form foundation.
- **UI / Flux / Alpine / Vite:** Flux Tables/Search/Filters/Pagination/Tree/Forms/Combobox/Badge/Dialog; Alpine scanner field capture only if needed; common assets.
- **Suggested Packages:** Mature barcode generation candidate only for rendering, not identity allocation; inspect compatibility later.
- **Permissions / Validation / Audit / States / Print:** catalog manage and cost-field scope; unique immutable item code/barcode, local format/serial concurrency, hierarchy cycle; audit identity/preference; label print blocked until pricing.
- **Manual Browser Verification:** Create/search exact code/barcode/name, duplicate/concurrent allocation, supplier change stability, attributes no variants, hierarchy cycle, unauthorized fields, RTL/LTR.
- **Definition of Done:** DoD; stable identity and search demonstrable with no stock or price side effect.
- **Current local implementation:** Categories, brands, products, barcodes, and local barcode sequences are migrated with unique/FK/index constraints. Category cycle/dependency guards, immutable normalized item codes, exact-priority bounded search, supplier/local barcode actions, server authorization, transaction-bound audit events, responsive Flux screens, and catalog-gated routes/navigation are implemented. Local System Administrator browser evidence covers the implemented screens and mutation paths. TSK-010 remains complete for its identity scope; product-card fields, types, protected media, and detail/full edit behavior are implemented only under the active TSK-011 scope.
- **Local closure evidence:** DEC-038-approved catalog `View (A)` is seeded for System Administrator, Cashier (limited view), Purchasing Officer, Warehouse Manager, Pricing Officer, and Accountant/Reviewer. Catalog `P`/`R` capabilities remain ungranted. Stable browser verification passed cashier view-only/forged-create denial, reviewer view, branch-manager and no-access direct-route 403 denial, supplier duplicate rejection, allocation-key replay idempotency, category self-parent rejection, descendant-cycle rejection, and database integrity checks. **TSK-010 is closed for approved local scope.** TSK-011 and TSK-012 are also closed for approved local scope; TSK-013 is the next active task and has an implemented local slice with production/UAT boundaries still open.

### TSK-011 — Complete Product Cards, Types, Attributes, and Media

- **Task ID / Phase / Milestone / Status:** TSK-011; Phase 2; DM 2.1; **Completed for approved local scope**.
- **Title / Purpose / Description:** Deliver full bilingual product card, standard/composite/service type behavior, reportable attributes, main + four additional protected images and lifecycle.
- **Traceability:** MD-04–MD-05, PRC-02; US-002, US-005; FLW-CAT-01; UI UI-CAT-001–003; AC-MD-04–05, AC-PRC-02; SEC-006–010, SEC-016–017, SEC-022–024.
- **Dependencies / Required Inputs:** TSK-010; `docs/23-product-barcode-policy.md`; production types, composition data, UOM, required fields, images, and retention remain configurable or pending.
- **Database Entities:** `products`, `product_images`, `attachments`, categories/brands/supplier links; composition lines only if approved.
- **Backend / Livewire / Blade Deliverables:** type-specific validation/actions, protected media, searchable/reportable fields; product detail and full form.
- **UI / Flux / Alpine / Vite:** Flux Form Sections/Inputs/Textareas/Combobox/Radio/Upload/Tabs/Cards/Image/Timeline; Alpine image ordering only if necessary; Vite image styles.
- **Suggested Packages:** Approved media capability candidate after security/version review; do not build a media library or install now.
- **Permissions / Validation / Audit / States / Print:** product/type/media manage, cost scope; 1 main + max 4 extra, safe files, post-use type guard; changes audited; product card print optional.
- **Manual Browser Verification:** All fields/types, invalid combinations, file attacks/limits/access, image order/count, search/report attributes, responsive RTL/LTR.
- **Definition of Done:** DoD; all PRD fields usable and no implicit variant balances.
- **Closure review (2026-08-04):** TSK-011 is **Completed for approved local scope**. Browser verification passed the approved card/type/attribute/media behavior, immutable item code, stale-update denial, protected media limits and authorization, cost denial, RTL/LTR/mobile layout, and the TSK-010 regression boundary. Oversized-file UX now renders a localized inline message before upload for the approved 8 MB application limit and renders a localized server-boundary message when the local PHP upload limit rejects the request. The PHP runtime boundary is documented; it does not weaken the application policy. Composite component behavior remains explicitly deferred by the insufficient approved contract. Production values, UAT, automated-test coverage, and later tasks remain open.
