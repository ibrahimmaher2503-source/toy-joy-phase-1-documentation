# 35 — Document State Machines

**Product:** TOY & JOY  
**Phase:** Phase 1  
**Status:** Detailed implementation specification derived from the approved PRD, Implementation Plan, Architecture, Roles/Permissions, and policies 17–29  
**Authority order:** PRD functional behavior → Implementation Plan sequencing/phase gates → approved decisions/policies → this specification  
**Important:** Exact production master data, legal wording, hardware models, provider choices, and final numeric limits remain configurable where the source documents do not define them.

## 1. Purpose

Provide explicit state/transition maps for all Phase 1 controlled documents. This document supplements the generic approval policy; module rules remain authoritative where more specific.

## 2. Global Rules

- State changes occur through named actions.
- Server authorization and scope required.
- Invalid/skipped/backward transitions fail.
- Submitted/approved/final/closed records lock relevant fields.
- Approved/final history is immutable.
- Correction uses reference document/event.
- Reason required for reject/cancel/reverse/override where specified.
- Transitions are transaction-safe and idempotent.
- Stale versions are rejected.

## 3. Common Draft Approval Machine

`draft → submitted → approved`

Alternatives:

- `submitted → rejected`
- `submitted → draft` via controlled withdrawal
- `draft/submitted → cancelled`
- `approved → reversed/superseded` by reference

## 4. Purchase Order

States:

- Draft.
- Submitted.
- Approved.
- Partially Received.
- Received.
- Cancelled.
- Closed.

Transitions:

- Draft → Submitted.
- Submitted → Approved through a named, authorized approval action; requester self-approval is denied and this local PO approval has no stock, cost, invoice, or receipt effect.
- Approved → Partially Received/Received through downstream receipts; these transitions remain TSK-015 and must be driven by posted receiving effects, not a manually assigned status.
- Draft/Submitted → Cancelled in the approved local TSK-014 slice with a required reason and audit event.
- Approved → Closed in the approved local TSK-014 slice as an administrative close with no stock, cost, invoice, or receipt effect.
- Partially Received → Received through downstream receipts.
- Received → Closed through the downstream receiving/closure policy.
- No stock effect from the PO itself.

**Local boundary note (DEC-044):** TSK-014 implements the Draft, Submitted, Approved, Cancelled, and local Approved → Closed slice only. `Partially Received` and `Received`, receipt links, short closure, and all stock/cost effects remain downstream TSK-015 behavior and are not implemented by the PO screen.

## 5. Purchase Invoice/Receipt

- Draft.
- Submitted.
- Approved.
- Rejected.
- Reversed.

Approval posts stock/cost atomically. Approved record immutable.

## 6. Supplier Return

- Draft.
- Submitted.
- Approved.
- Rejected.
- Cancelled before posting.
- Reversed after posting.

Approval reduces eligible stock and references an approved purchase-invoice line. Cost is copied from that source line and revalidated at approval; no WAC/fallback/no-reference path exists. Reason rows and approved effective financial-setting versions remain Owner-configurable inputs.

## 7. Price Version

- Draft.
- Submitted.
- Approved.
- Rejected.
- Superseded.
- Cancelled.

Approval activates one location price and supersedes prior active version.

## 8. Label Queue/Job

Reprint creates print event, not silent reset.
