# 48 — POS Financial Calculation Policy

**Product:** TOY & JOY
**Phase:** Phase 1
**Status:** Derived implementation policy — team-adopted defaults, owner approval outstanding
**Authority:** POS-03–POS-07, POS-05, CSH-02–CSH-04, NFR-06
**Blockers:** BLK-008, BLK-013
**Companion to:** `docs/31` (POS specification), `docs/26` (discount/return policy), `docs/41` (rounding conventions)

---

## 1. Purpose

`docs/31` defines the POS flow and `docs/26` defines discount and return behaviour. Neither defines the arithmetic: where rounding occurs, how optional tax interacts with discount, how a split payment settles, and how cash change is rounded.

The same rule as `docs/41` applies — rounding must be defined once and applied identically on screen, on the thermal receipt, on the A4 invoice, and in reports.

## 2. Requirement Classification

| Item | Classification |
|---|---|
| Tax is optional **per invoice**, sequence stays unified | PRD Requirement (POS-04) |
| Only one discount type may apply to an amount; no stacking | PRD Requirement (POS-05) |
| Printed invoice shows item, quantity, original price, discount line, net | PRD Requirement (POS-06) |
| Totals show gross, total discount, net, optional tax, final | PRD Requirement (POS-06) |
| Gift Receipt shows no prices | PRD Requirement (POS-07) |
| Cash and manually recorded electronic payment with evidence | PRD Requirement (POS-03) |
| Cashier never sees expected values before closing | PRD Requirement (CSH-02) |
| Rounding level (line vs receipt) | **PENDING — POSF-01** |
| Cash rounding / smallest denomination | **PENDING — POSF-02** |
| Split payment ordering and residual | **PENDING — POSF-03** |
| Discount replacement behaviour | **PENDING — POSF-04** |

## 3. Calculation Order

Proposed canonical order:

```
1. line gross            = quantity × unit price
2. line discount         (one type only, POS-05)
3. line net              = line gross − line discount
4. invoice discount      allocated pro-rata to lines
5. taxable base          = Σ line net after allocation
6. tax                   only if the authorised user enabled it (POS-04)
7. invoice total         = taxable base + tax
8. cash rounding         applied to the payable amount only
```

Rounding is applied at step 3 and step 7 only. Intermediate values are not re-rounded.

Step 8 is critical: cash rounding adjusts **what is collected**, not the invoice total. The difference is posted as a distinct rounding line so that the drawer reconciles and the invoice remains arithmetically intact. Absorbing it into the total makes the receipt total disagree with the sum of its lines.

## 4. Discount Non-Stacking

POS-05 is explicit: only one discount type may apply to an amount. Implementation:

1. When a second discount is applied to the same amount, the system **blocks it or offers replacement**. It never sums them.
2. Replacement is an explicit user choice, recorded with actor and audit.
3. Customer/group discount and item/invoice discount compete for the same amount and cannot coexist on it.
4. A discount above the configured limit requires approval (`DEC-043` §4), and the approval is bound to that invoice.

This must be enforced in the calculation service, not in the UI. A blocked stack that is only prevented by a disabled button is not enforcement (NFR-03).

---

## 5. Tax

POS-04 makes tax a per-invoice choice by an authorised user, with the invoice sequence unchanged. Therefore:

1. Tax applicability is a stored attribute of the invoice, not a global setting read at print time.
2. The tax rate and inclusive/exclusive mode in force at approval are stored on the invoice (`docs/46` §3), so reprinting an old receipt reproduces the original figures.
3. Numbering is unaffected — taxed and untaxed invoices share one sequence (POS-04, NFR-06).
4. Where the settings lock says purchase tax is disabled (`DEC-043`), that does not disable sales tax. They are independent settings.

---

## 6. Payments

| Rule | Behaviour |
|---|---|
| Methods | Cash and manually recorded electronic (POS-03). No gateway in Phase 1 |
| Split payment | Multiple payment rows per invoice, each with method, amount, and evidence reference |
| Ordering | Electronic amounts are entered explicitly; cash settles the residual (POSF-03) |
| Overpayment | Cash overpayment produces change; electronic overpayment is rejected |
| Evidence | Electronic payment requires an attached terminal receipt image via `docs/18` private storage |
| Underpayment | The invoice cannot be approved. Partial settlement is not a Phase 1 concept for retail |

The sum of payment rows must equal the payable amount including any cash-rounding line. This is checked in the approval transaction, not at save time.

---

## 7. Receipt and Gift Receipt

Per POS-06, the printed invoice shows, per item: description, quantity, original price; and where an item discount exists, a following line with the discount and the resulting net item value. Totals show gross items, total discount, net after discount, optional tax, and final total.

Per POS-07, the Gift Receipt shows **no prices at all** — no unit price, no discount, no total, and no tax. It carries enough reference to identify the original sale for exchange or return. Any field that permits price inference (line totals, a payable amount, a discount percentage) is excluded.

---

## 8. Shift Interaction

CSH-02 forbids showing expected values before the cashier submits actual amounts. Therefore the calculation of expected cash and expected electronic totals must run **server-side after submission** (CSH-03), and no endpoint may return expected values to a cashier session before that point. A hidden field in the page source is a violation.

Variance = actual − expected, computed per method, exposed only to authorised managers/reviewers.

## 9. Manual Browser Verification

Verify: hand-calculated invoice matches screen, thermal receipt, A4 invoice, and report identically; a second discount on the same amount is blocked or replaced, never summed; discount above limit requires approval; tax toggled per invoice with the sequence unbroken; a reprinted old invoice reproduces original figures after a settings change; split payment must sum exactly; electronic payment without evidence is blocked; cash rounding appears as its own line and the drawer reconciles; Gift Receipt exposes no price anywhere including page source; expected values unreachable from a cashier session before submission; RTL/LTR and mobile clean.

No automated tests are created or executed.
